# This script is for Linux masternodes with Sentinel issues, where Sentinel isn't running properly from the command line.
# Sentinel is a network process akin to a heartbeat to tell the network the masternode is up and running.
# Therefore, if Sentinel is not running often enough, wallets will report the masternode is in "Watchdog_Expired" status.
# Typically, Sentinel is run via a cronjob that fires every minute, but this does not work for all installations.
#
# Usage
# 1. CD to your home directory (`cd ~`)
# 2. Open a file to write into (`nano startsent`)
# 3. Copy contents of this script to the open file; to save, Control + X
# 4. Adjust any variable settings to reflect your Sentinel path correctly, and set the number of loops, or 0 for continuous.
# 5. Set the execute bit on the file (`chmod +x startsent)
# 5. Run the script (`./startsent &') - exit the terminal if you want.
#       If you keep the terminal open, script will provide information to the terminal.
# 6. Let the script run and watch for your Wallet's status to change to "Enabled"
